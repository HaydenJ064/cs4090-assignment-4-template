1. Unit Testing
  ==================================================== tests coverage ====================================================
  ___________________________________ coverage: platform linux, python 3.12.3-final-0 ____________________________________

  Name            Stmts   Miss  Cover
  -----------------------------------
  app.py             60     60     0%
  tasks.py           31      3    90%
  test_tasks.py      64      1    98%
  -----------------------------------
  TOTAL             155     64    59%

  Here is what comes when pytest -v --cov=. test_tasks.py, to show the total coverage over each section of code, where the test_tasks.py is the coverage for app.py as running tests while the streamlit app is running is much more complex
  The process was primarily just adding more tests to each file with asserts to make sure the output matched expectation
  The added button works similary to run the tests over main where it can be seen that 7/8 pass them
  The coverage was met by making sure to hit as many possible cases so that as many lines as possible would be ran
  In code documentation aims to have names for functions be as clear as possible to make changes easier as they are needed

2. Bug Reporting and fixing
  Bug #1
    Unique IDs are not generated in a thorough manner, instead just using their current index.
    Can be recreated by deleting and readding new tasks.
    It would be expected for each task to still be unique if others are removed
    High priority

  Bug #2
    Datetime handling was done purely as strings, causing issues over longer periods of time
    Seen while reading through code
    It would be expected for them to be stored as datetime objects
    Med priority

  Bug #3
    JSON decoding didnt offer any error messages
    Found when messing with json outside of the app
    Interacting with data should have more clear error messages
    Low priority

  Bug #4
    Input validation for the title of a task
    No validation on the input led to bugs
    Should make sure that all input given is safe
    Med priority

  Bug #5
    Get was inconsistently used
    Seen while reading through code
    Should be consisten to prevent errors
    Low priority
